Sittin' On The Dock Of The Bay

就这样坐在码头



Sittin' in the morning sun. I`ll be sittin' when the evening comes.

Watching the ships roll in. And I'll watch 'em roll away again.

天一亮，我就坐在那，一直坐到天黑。

看着船儿一只只来，又看着它们一只只走。

Sittin' on the dock of the bay. Watching the tide roll away.

Sitting on the dock of the bay. Wasting time.

就这样坐在码头，看潮起潮落。

就这样坐在码头，任时光流逝。



I left my home in Georgia. And I headed for the Frisco bay.

I have got nothing to live for. Look like nothings gonna come my way.

我离开家乡，来到这个码头。

不知是为了什么，也不知有谁会在意。

Sittin on the dock of the bay. Watching the tide roll away.

Sittin on the dock of the bay. Wasting time.

就这样坐在码头，看潮涨潮落。

就这样坐在码头，任时光流逝。



Look like nothings gonna change. Everthing seems to stay the same.

I can't do what ten people tell me to do. So I guess I'll just remain the same.

看起来什么都没有变，一切都和从前一样。

只是再也没有了我的事，我只能继续坐着。



Sittin here resting my bones. And this loneliness won't leave me alone.

Just 1000 miles from home. Just to make this dock my home.

坐在这里晒晒老骨头，孤独不会让我再孤单。

家乡远在千里外，唯有此处是我家。

Sittin on the dock of the bay. Watching the tide roll away, ooh.

Sittin on the dock of the bay. Wasting time

就这样坐在码头，看潮涨潮落

就这样坐在码头，任时光流逝
